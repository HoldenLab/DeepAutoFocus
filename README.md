INFORMATION This is a MicroManager hardware autofocus plugin, used in Whitley et al bioRxiv 2020, developed between the Henriques and Holden laboratories. This plugin will perform microscopy autofocus while imaging a sample with visible fluorescence light, using the cross correlated signal from infrared brightfield microscopy running independently on a second camera, based on the principle described in McGorty et al, Optical Nanoscopy 2013.

This code is provided as is and without warranty to support reproducibility and open science. It is in-house code, undocumented, minimally commented, warts and all! We aim increase the  user friendliness of this software & hardware in the near future - watch this space!
