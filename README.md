# DeepDriftCorrect

This is a MicroManager hardware autofocus plugin for live lateral and axial microscopy drift correction using the cross correlated signal from infrared brightfield microscopy running independently on a second camera, based on the principle described in McGorty et al, Optical Nanoscopy 2013. 

The versionin the v1.0.0 release is associated with the Whitley et al bioRxiv 2020 preprint and was originally developed between the Henriques and Holden laboratories. This plugin will perform axial autofocus at depth using the infrared camera while imaging a sample with visible fluorescence light.

We have now updated the plugin to include lateral drift correction based on image cross-correlation as a v1.1.0 release. This has also been improved with regard to distributability. Full installation and accompanying hardware instructions are available on the <a href="">LifeHack microscope website</a>.
