# DeepDriftCorrect

This is a MicroManager hardware autofocus plugin, used in Whitley et al bioRxiv 2020, developed between the Henriques and Holden laboratories. This plugin will perform microscopy autofocus while imaging a sample with visible fluorescence light, using the cross correlated signal from infrared brightfield microscopy running independently on a second camera, based on the principle described in McGorty et al, Optical Nanoscopy 2013. This version is recorded in release v1.0.0

The plugin has since been updated to include lateral drift correction based on image cross-correlation in v1.1.0. This has also been improved with regard to distributability. Full installation and accompanying hardware instructions are available on the <a href="">LifeHack microscope website</a>
